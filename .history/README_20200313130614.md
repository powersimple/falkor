FALKOR

Yes, this is named after the Luck Dragon from The Never Ending Story, because this repo needed a name.
And a kindly flying dog seemed appropriate.

Falkor is many things. First, it's a Wordpress theme.
It also has a node-gulp-sass for bundling SCSS and JS
It uses the Wordpress Rest API and renders static json packets
These are all quaint and useful in a 2D content World

But now we're in the webXR world. and it's time to build for it.
So this repo will be integrating the best of WebXR into it for immersive experiences on supporting browsers.

If you have Oculus Quest or a device with the Mozilla Reality Browser.
